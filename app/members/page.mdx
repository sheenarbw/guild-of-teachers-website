# Members 

If teaching code is something you would like to get better at, or if you have skills to share, we'd love to have you!

## What does membership look like?

Currently, the community is housed on Discord. This will be a good place to meet like-minded people who are either growing or sharing teaching skills (or both).

There are many discussions worth having - a lot of the people teaching code are not trained educators, there have been a lot of wheels invented and reinvented, and people are implementing all sorts of patterns and anti-patterns. 

I suspect that there will be some big learnings and some big disagreements. There is a lot of passion in this space.

## What's the plan?

Initially we'll be hosing regular panel discussions on different topics in education. 

We will also be creating our own teacher-training courses and workshops to help people level up fast. 

This is going to be a long journey, this is just the beginning.
