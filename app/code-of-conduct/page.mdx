# Code of Conduct

This code of conduct is a living document. As we grow and learn this is likely to change. 

We are dedicated to providing a respectful, harassment-free community for everyone. We want all our members to flourish. We recognize that there will be differences in opinions, but we strive to overcome those differences with grace. 

There is a lot of passion in education, and a lot of different contradictory beliefs. When disagreements happen it is important to handle them with grace. Keep the following in mind:

- We are all here to grow so that we can better help others to grow
- If you and I disagree then it doesn't mean it's you versus me, a disagreement is an opportunity to get closer to the truth. Curiosity will help everyone win

To make clear what is expected, all members are required to conform to the following Code of Conduct:

## Our Community 

Members of our community are open, considerate, and respectful. Behaviors that reinforce these values contribute to a positive environment, and include:

- Being open. Members of the community are open to collaboration.
- Focusing on what is best for the community. We’re respectful of the processes set forth in the community, and we work within them.
- Acknowledging time and effort. We’re respectful of the volunteer efforts that permeate the community. We’re thoughtful when addressing the efforts of others, keeping in mind that oftentimes the labour was completed simply for the good of the community.
- Showing empathy towards other community members. We’re attentive in our communications, whether in person or online, and we’re tactful when approaching differing views.
- Being considerate. Members of the community are considerate of their peers.
- Being respectful. We’re respectful of others, their positions, their skills, their commitments, and their efforts. We’re receptive to constructive comments and criticism, as the experiences and skill sets of other members contribute to the whole of our efforts.
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism. When we disagree, we are courteous in raising our issues.
- Using welcoming and inclusive language. We’re accepting of all who wish to take part in our activities, fostering an environment where anyone can participate and everyone can make a difference.

## Our Standards 

Every member of our community has the right to have their identity respected. The Guild of Teachers community is dedicated to providing a positive experience for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity, nationality, race, religion (or lack thereof), education, cultural and cognitive variations, or socio-economic status.
