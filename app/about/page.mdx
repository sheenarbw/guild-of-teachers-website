# About

We are a group of people who love teaching and want to get better at it and help others to get better at it.

We aim to add leverage to teachers through:

- education and personal growth: Teaching is a set of skills and mindsets, not a "you have it or you don't" thing. We want to make sure that teachers are equipped with evidence based skills and techniques so that their teaching has a bigger impact
- opportunities to teach: This might be by finding or creating volunteer opportunities, or it could be through job opportunities

## Longer term

We've chosen a very specific niche to start off with: software development in Python. But a lot of what is relevant in this niche is relevant elsewhere. 

As we build up our community and resources, we plan to expand in a few different directions. There are a lot of different options and opportunities and the next steps will be chosen based on the needs and abilities of our members, and the potential impact of different activities. 

Here are a few different things we could expand into in future:

- Different programming languages: This is a pretty obvious move. A lot of the skills needed for teaching foundational Python can be easily applied to different languages
- Teaching younger people: This is especially impactful in areas where the school system is not up to scratch. Poor schooling casts a long shadow on individuals and entire nations
- Digital/tech disciplines outside of software development: This could include other "tech" or "digital" skills such as computer literacy, basic data literacy, UX design, AI-related competencies, and many many more things 

The sky is the limit here. While the techniques used to teach software development might be very specific to one domain, those techniques should be based on foundational, evidence-based teaching and learning principles. Once we are good at spreading knowledge about the foundational mechanisms of teaching, that knowledge can be spread in other domains.
